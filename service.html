             <p>
                 One of the easiest and most effective ways we can and should utilize, 
                 to serve the Lord is through donation. Amongst all the donations one can make,
                 what better than to give to the poor and needy, and of them, the donation of food is 
                 the most satisfying, not only to the one who receives it but to the one who feeds a 
                 hungry person. It is such a simple, and yet such an effective way to help others.
